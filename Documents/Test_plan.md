### Strategy

The strategy that will be used to test the game is to test it manually. The tester will have to test the game throughout the development phase and also afterwards in order to prevent the appearance of bugs and to be able to resolve them if there are any.

| Collision | The player should not be able to walk through walls. |
| Game Levels | Check if the game progresses through levels correctly. The game should change level when the player eats all the dots. |
